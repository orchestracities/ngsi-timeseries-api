# Benchmark

This package contains modules for testing different backends and their
translations to NGSI.

The dependencies are (for now) all into the root project's requirements.txt

    pip install -r requirements.txt

Before attempting to run the tests, remember to launch the docker containers.

    docker-compose up -d
