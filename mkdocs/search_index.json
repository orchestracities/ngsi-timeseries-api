            "text": "Usage Overview\n\n\nFirst you need to have QuantumLeap runnning (of course). Refer to the \nInstallation Manual\n for instructions.\n\n\nThen, you need to connect Orion Context Broker to QuantumLeap through a subscription for each Entity Type whose historical data you are interested in. Historical data for each entity type will be persisted as long as the subscription is active.\n\n\nThe flow is therefore the following\n\n\n\n\nCreate an Orion subscription for each entity type of your interest once\n\n\nInsert and update your data to Orion as usual\n\n\nDone, your historical data will be persisted in QuantumLeap's database.\n\n\n\n\nLet's have a look in more detail of each step.\n\n\nOrion Subscription\n\n\nAs stated before, the link between Orion and QuantumLeap is established through a subscription you need to create. It is therefore important that you understand well how the NGSIv2 Subscription mechanism works. This is carefully explained in the corresponding section of \nOrion docs\n.\n\n\nHere's an example of the payload of the subscription you need to create in Orion to establish the link Orion-QuantumLeap.\n\n\n{\n    \"description\": \"Test subscription\",\n    \"subject\": {\n        \"entities\": [\n        {\n            \"idPattern\": \".*\",\n            \"type\": \"Room\"\n        }\n        ],\n        \"condition\": {\n            \"attrs\": [  # Here the list of attrs whose change will trigger notifications. Empty array means track any change.\n            \"temperature\"\n            ]\n        }\n    },\n    \"notification\": {\n        \"http\": {\n            \"url\": http://quantumleap:8668/notify\n        },\n        \"attrs\": [  # Here the list of attrs to be persisted in time. Empty array means save all entity attributes.\n        \"temperature\"\n        ],\n        \"metadata\": [\"dateCreated\", \"dateModified\"]\n    },\n    \"throttling\": 5\n}\n\n\n\nImportant things to notice from the example.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nYou can create any valid NGSI subscription for your entities.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThough not compulsory, it is highly recommended to include the \n\"metadata\": [\"dateCreated\", \"dateModified\"]\n part in the \n\"notification\"\n part of the subscription. This instructs Orion to include the modification time of the attributes in the notification. This timestamp will be used as the time index in the database. If this is somehow missing, QuantumLeap will use its current system time at which the notification arrived, which might not be exactly what you want.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNotifications must come in complete \nNGSI JSON Entity Representation\n form. Other forms, such as the \nsimplified entity representation\n are not supported by QL because they lack information on attribute types, required by QL to make proper translations. This means, don't use options like \n\"attrsFormat\": \"keyValues\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe \n\"url\"\n field of the subscription specifies where Orion will send the notifications. I.e, this must be QuantumLeap's \n/notify\n endpoint. By default, QuantumLeap listens at port 8668.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nData Insertion\n\n\nNow you are ready to insert (or keep updating) your entities as you've always done in Orion Context Broker. Refer to the \ndocs\n for more instructions.\n\n\nIt's not a problem if the first insert was done before you created the subscription. Of course, you will get historical records of the updates happening after the subscription was created.\n\n\nHere's an example of an insert payload that will generate a notification based on the subscription example shown before.\n\n\n{\n    'id': 'Room1',\n    'type': 'Room',\n    'temperature': {\n        'value': 24.2,\n        'type': 'Number',\n        'metadata': {}\n    },\n    'pressure': {\n        'value': 720,\n        'type': 'Number',\n        'metadata': {}\n    }\n}\n\n\n\nAttributes DataType Translation\n\n\nThe table below shows which attribute types will be translated to which \nCrate Data Types\n.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNGSI Type\n\n\nCrate Datatype\n\n\nObservation\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArray\n\n\narray(string)\n\n\nTODO: Support arrays of other types.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBoolean\n\n\nboolean\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDateTime\n\n\ntimestamp\n\n\n-\n\n\n\n\n\n\nInteger\n\n\nlong\n\n\nTODO: Fix this inconsistency ASAP!\n\n\n\n\n\n\ngeo:json\n\n\ngeo_shape\n\n\nNGSI Simple Location Format is not yet supported.

Further details are explained in the \nCrate\n and \nGrafana\n sections, respectively.\n\n\nWhat you need to know in the mean time is that QuantumLeap will create one table per each entity type. Table names are formed with the \"et\" prefix plus the lowercase version of the entity type. I.e, if your entity type is \nAirQualityObserved\n, the corresponding table name will be \netairqualityobserved\n. All created tables for now belong to the default \"doc\" schema.\n\n\nThe Time Index\n\n\nA fundamental index in the timeseries database is the time index. You may be wondering... where is it stored?\n\n\nQuantumLeap will persist the time index for each notification in a special column called \ntime_index\n.  If you payed attention in the \nOrion Subscription\n section, you know at least which value is used as the time index. This is, the \n\"dateModified\"\n value notified by Orion or, if you missed that option in the subscription, the notification arrival time.\n\n\nIn the future, this could be more flexible and allow users to define any Datetime attribute to be used as the time index.",

The  requirements.txt  still needs to be split between testing and production, that's why the docker image is massive for now.  In the file tree structure you can find (to be refactored soon):   ngsi-timeseries-api  client : holds a simple Orion Context Broker client to ease integration testing. To be moved out of here at some point.  experiments : sandbox for quick manual tests to try some stuff and derive new test cases.  python-flask  : will hold the implementation of the swagger-defined API controllers.  reporter : this module is acting as the receiver of the notifications, who \"parses/validates\" them before being handled to the translators.  translators : specific translators for timeseries databases.  utils : common shared stuff looking for a better place to live in.",
