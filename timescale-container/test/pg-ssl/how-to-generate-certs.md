# How to generate SSL certificates

Adapted from Postgres 10 official documentation:

- [18.9.3. Creating Certificates](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/10/ssl-tcp.html#SSL-CERTIFICATE-CREATION)

**Warning**: The below procedure is only suitable for testing locally,
don't even think of doing the same for prod!


### Create self-signed certificate

Create a simple self-signed certificate for localhost valid for 10 years:

    $ openssl req -new -x509 -days 3650 -nodes -text -out server.crt \
        -keyout server.key -subj "/CN=localhost"

Then do:

    $ chmod og-rwx server.key

because the server will reject the file if its permissions are more liberal
than this. 

### Create server certificate

To create a server certificate whose identity can be validated by clients,
first create a certificate signing request (CSR) and a public/private key
file:

    $ openssl req -new -nodes -text -out root.csr \
        -keyout root.key -subj "/CN=root.localhost"
    $ chmod og-rwx root.key

Then, sign the request with the key to create a root certificate authority
(using the default OpenSSL configuration file location on Linux and MacOS):

    $ openssl x509 -req -in root.csr -text -days 3650 \
        -extfile /etc/ssl/openssl.cnf \
        -signkey root.key -out root.crt

Finally, create a server certificate signed by the new root certificate
authority:

    $ openssl req -new -nodes -text -out server.csr \
        -keyout server.key -subj "/CN=localhost"
    $ chmod og-rwx server.key
    $ openssl x509 -req -in server.csr -text -days 3650 \
        -CA root.crt -CAkey root.key -CAcreateserial \
        -out server.crt
