# Used Ports

The table below summarises the default ports for each of the services typically
used with QuantumLeap. So, if you run them behind firewalls, remember to
include the corresponding rules.

| -------------     |:-------------:| :-----|
|TCP| 1026|  Orion CB |

are used within the cluster.
