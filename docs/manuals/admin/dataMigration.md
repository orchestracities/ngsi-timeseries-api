# Data-Migration-Tool

Data-Migration-Tool is designed to automatically migrate data stored in [STH-Comet](https://github.com/telefonicaid/fiware-sth-comet) to [QuantumLeap](https://github.com/smartsdk/ngsi-timeseries-api) database. After data migration, data can be accessed by using QuantumLeap's [API](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/smartsdk/ngsi-tsdb/0.2).

This tool is developed in [Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_(software_platform)) using [Eclipse](https://www.eclipse.org/). A python script is used to convert data in [MongoDB](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo) to be compatible for [CrateDB](https://github.com/crate/crate).

User guide for the tool is available [here](https://github.com/pooja1pathak/Data-Migration-Tool/tree/master/docs/manuals).
