# Configuration

## Environment variables

To configure QuantumLeap you can use the following environment variables:

| Variable           | Description             | 
| -------------------|-------------------------|
| `CRATE_HOST`       | CrateDB Host            |
| `CRATE_PORT`       | CrateDB Port            |
| `DEFAULT_LIMIT`    | Max number of rows a query can retrieve |
| `KEEP_RAW_ENTITY`  | Whether to store original entity data |
| `POSTGRES_HOST`    | PostgreSQL Host         |
| `POSTGRES_PORT`    | PostgreSQL Port         |
| `POSTGRES_DB_NAME` | PostgreSQL default db   |
| `POSTGRES_DB_USER` | PostgreSQL user         |
| `POSTGRES_DB_PASS` | PostgreSQL password     |
| `POSTGRES_USE_SSL` | `t` or `f` enable SSL   |
| `REDIS_HOST`       | Redis Host              |
| `REDIS_PORT`       | Redis Port              |
| `USE_GEOCODING`    | `True` or `False` enable or disable geocoding |
| `DEFAULT_CACHE_TTL`| Time to live of metadata cache, default: 60 (seconds) |                              |
| `QL_CONFIG`        | Pathname for tenant  configuration  |
| `QL_DEFAULT_DB`    | Default backend: `timescale` or `crate`  |
| `CRATE_WAIT_ACTIVE_SHARDS` | Specifies the number of shard copies that need to be active for write operations to proceed. Default `1`. See related [crate documentation](https://crate.io/docs/crate/reference/en/4.3/sql/statements/create-table.html#write-wait-for-active-shards). |
| `USE_FLASK`        | `True` or `False` to use flask server (only for Dev) or gunicorn. Default to `False`  |
| `LOGLEVEL`         | Define the log level for all services (`DEBUG`, `INFO`, `WARNING` , `ERROR`)      |

**NOTE**
* `DEFAULT_LIMIT`. This variable specifies the upper limit L of rows a query
  operation is allowed to fetch from the database and return to client. The
  actual number of rows will be the least of L and the client-specified limit
  or L if the client didn't specify a limit. If not set through this variable,
  L defaults to 10,000. This variable is read in on each API call to query
  endpoints so it can be set dynamically and it will affect every subsequent
  query operation. The variable string value you set should be convertible to
  an integer, if not, the default value of 10,000 will be used instead.
* `KEEP_RAW_ENTITY`. If true, then each notified entity will be stored in its
  entirety as JSON in an additional column of the corresponding entity table.
  (This may result in the table needing up to 10x more storage.) If false, the
  JSON will only be stored (as detailed earlier) in case the conversion from
  JSON to tabular fails---typically this happens when the notified entity
  contains a previously notified attribute whose type is now different than
  it used to be in the past. This variable is read in on each API call to the
  notify endpoint so it can be set dynamically and it will affect every
  subsequent insert operation. Any of the following (case insensitive) values
  will be interpreted as true: 'true', 'yes', '1', 't', 'y'. Anything else
  counts for false, which is also the default value if the variable is not set.

## Database selection per different tenant

QuantumLeap can use different time series databases to persist and
query NGSI data. Currently both [CrateDB][crate] and [Timescale][timescale]
are supported as back ends, even though query functionality is
not yet available for Timescale.

If no configuration is provided QuantumLeap assumes CrateDB is
the back end to use and will store all incoming NGSI data in it.
However, different back ends can be configured for specific tenants
through a YAML configuration file. To use this feature, you have
to set the environment variable below:

* `QL_CONFIG`: absolute pathname of the QuantumLeap YAML configuration
  file. If not set, the default configuration will be used where only
  the Crate back end is available.

The YAML configuration file specifies what back end to use for which
tenant as well as the default back end to use for any other tenant
not explicitly mentioned in the file. Here's an example YAML
configuration:

    tenants:
        t1:
            backend: Timescale
        t2:
            backend: Crate
        t3:
            backend: Timescale

    default-backend: Crate

With this configuration, any NGSI entity coming in for tenant `t1`
or `t3` will be stored in Timescale whereas tenant `t2` will use
Crate. Any tenant other than `t1`, `t2`, or `t3` gets the default
Crate back end.
