"""
The reporter is the service responsible for handling NGSI notifications, validating them, and feeding the corresponding
updates to the translator.

The reporter needs to know the form of the entity (i.e, name and types of its attributes). There are two approaches:
    1 - Clients tell reporter which entities they care about and Reporter goes find the metadata in Context Broker
    2 - The reporter only consumes the Context Broker notifications and builds little by little the whole entity.
        In this case, the notifications must come with some mimimum amount of required data (e.g, entity_type,
        entity_id, a time index and the updated value[s]). Ideally, in the first notification the reporter would be
        notified of all the entity attributes so that it can tell the translator how to create the complete
        corresponding table[s] in the database.

For now, we have adopted approach 2.

TODO:
- Validate entity and attribute names against valid NGSI names and valid [Crate names](https://crate.io/docs/crate/reference/en/latest/sql/ddl/basics.html#naming-restrictions) 
- Raise warning and act accordingly when receiving entity with equal lowercased attributes.
- Consider offering an API endpoint to receive just the user's entities of
interest and make QL actually perform the corresponding subscription to orion. I.e, QL must be told where orion is.

    The strategy for now is simple. Received notifications are expected to have the dateModified field
    (http://docs.orioncontextbroker.apiary.io/#introduction/specification/virtual-attributes). If the notification lacks
    this attribute, the received time will be assumed.

    In future, this could be enhanced with customs notifications where user specifies which attribute is to be used as
