# NOTE. Equals query support.
# We actually have all the bits and pieces in place to do this, except Crate
# doesn't like the query we generate, since the within function only seems to
# work with a first argument of geo_point even though the docs state it should
# work with any shape. I opened an issue about it in the Crate repo:
#
#   - https://github.com/crate/crate/issues/7997
#
# after they fix the issue, zap the if block above to re-enable equals queries.
