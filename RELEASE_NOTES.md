### Important: Backward compatibility

This release breaks API backward compatibility. Existing `0.7.5` clients may
**not** be able to work with this new Quantum Leap version without code
changes.
In detail: version `0.7.6` changes the URL of the version, health and config
endpoints as indicated below:

      0.7.5           0.7.6
      -----           -----
    /v2/version      /version
    /v2/config       /config
    /v2/health       /health

Note that the semantics of the endpoints remains the same as version
 `0.7.5`.

### Important: Backward compatibility

This release breaks API backward compatibility. Existing 0.6.3 clients will
**not** be able to work with Quantum Leap 0.7.0 without code changes.
In detail: version 0.7.0 changes the structure of query results. Up to
version 0.6.3, Quantum Leap used the following JSON format for query results:

    {
        data: {
           ...query results...
        }
    }

Version 0.7.0 removes the `data` field and puts all the fields that make up
the query result at the top level as in e.g.

    {
        entityId: ...,
        index: ...,
        values: ...
    }
