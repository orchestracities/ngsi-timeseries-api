# Contributing to QuantumLeap

Thanks for checking out the QuantumLeap Project. We're excited to hear
and learn from you. We've put together the following guidelines to help
you figure out where you can best be helpful.

## Ground rules & expectations

Before we get started, here are a few things we expect from you (and
that you should expect from others):

- Be kind and thoughtful in your conversations around this project.
  We all come from different backgrounds and projects, which means we
  likely have different perspectives on "how open source is done."
  Try to listen to others rather than convince them that your way is
  correct.
- This project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct][conduct].
  By participating in this project, you agree to abide by its terms.
- If you open a pull request, you must sign the
  [Individual Contributor License Agreement][cla] by stating
  in a comment _"I have read the CLA Document and I hereby sign the CLA"_
- Please ensure that your contribution passes all tests. If there are
  test failures, you will need to address them before we can merge your
  contribution.
- When adding content, please consider if it is widely valuable. Please
  don't add references or links to things you or your employer have
  created as others will do so if they appreciate it.

## How to contribute

If you'd like to contribute, start by searching through the [issues][gi]
and [pull requests][pr] to see whether someone else has raised a similar
idea or question.

If you don't see your idea listed, and you think it fits into the goals
of this guide, do one of the following:

- **If your contribution is minor,** such as a typo fix, open a pull
  request.
- **If your contribution is major,** such as a new guide, start by
  opening an issue first. That way, other people can weigh in on the
  discussion before you do any work.

## Community

Discussions about the Open Source Guides take place on this repository's
[Issues][gi] and [Pull Requests][pr] sections. Anybody is welcome to join
these conversations.

Wherever possible, do not take these conversations to private channels,
including contacting the maintainers directly.
Keeping communication public means everybody can benefit and learn from
the conversation.
