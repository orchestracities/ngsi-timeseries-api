Contributions are welcome!

You can either pick one of the open issues and work on that, or provide enhacements according to your own needs.

To contribute:
1. Clone the repository
1. Identify a modular contribution to the code (avoid to large contributions, since reviewing them will be complex)
1. Create a branch in your repository where you tackle the "modular contributions"
  - For multiple contributions tackling different functionalities, create different branches
  - For all the new functionalities provide tests (see `setup_dev_env.sh` and `run.sh in the root to understand how tests can be run locally)
1. When done, verify that your code pass all the tests
1. If so, create a pull request against our repository (if tests are no passed review cannot be approved)
1. Wait for the review
1. Implement required changes
1. Wait for final approval
1. Done :) You can cancel the branch in your repository.
