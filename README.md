QuantumLeap is the first implementation of
[an API](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/smartsdk/ngsi-tsdb)
that supports the storage of
[FIWARE NGSIv2](https://fiware.github.io/specifications/ngsiv2/stable/)
data into a
[time series database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series_database).
It currently also experimentally supports the injection of
[NGSI-LD](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/CIM/001_099/009/01.01.01_60/gs_CIM009v010101p.pdf)
in  a backward compatible way with NGSI-v2 API. I.e. you can retrieve NGSI-LD
stored data via NGSI v2 API and retrieve data will be describe following NGSI
v2 format.

QuantumLeap is not a
[real time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing)
API, its purpose is to process notifications received from the Context Broker
and to create temporal records for them. In general, the whole FIWARE stack,
being based on a micro-service architecture, cannot be regarded as real time
in case you have requirements on guaranteed delivery in a given amount of time.

However, even though hard real time may not be FIWARE's forte, in our experience
a properly tuned FIWARE stack can perform extremely well and
handle very demanding IoT workloads without a glitch - you just need to
configure your infrastructure to handle that :)

## Install

Refer to the
[Installation Guide](https://quantumleap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/admin/).

QuantumLeap supports both Crate DB and Timescale as time-series DB
backends. The following versions are currently covered in tests
(see [.circleci/config.yml](https://github.com/orchestracities/ngsi-timeseries-api/blob/master/.circleci/config.yml#L204)):

- Crate backend: Crate DB version `4.2.7` up to `4.6.7`
- Timescale backend: Postgres version `12` up to `13` +
  Timescale extension `1.7.5` up to `2.3.0` + Postgis extension `2.5.*`.

As regards caching feature, QuantumLeap has been tested with Redis `4.*` up
to `6.2.3`.
Integration with Orion Context Broker is tested from version `2.4.2`
up to `3.3.1`.

Automated tests, to avoid too long testing time, are not combining all possible
versions. This anyhow should not be an issue given that component
integrations are not depending on each other.
In general, only latest version listed is actively supported.

PR [#373](https://github.com/orchestracities/ngsi-timeseries-api/pull/373)
introduced basic support for NGSI-LD. In short this means that using
the current endpoint you are able to store NGSI-LD payloads with few caveats
(see [#398](https://github.com/orchestracities/ngsi-timeseries-api/issue/398))

### Docker Images

Docker images are available on
[docker hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/orchestracities/quantumleap/):

- `latest` refers to the last release. This behaviour will be introduced
    since `0.8.3` release.
- `edge` refers to the version in master, this behaviour is introduced
    since `0.8.3-dev` activities.
- `*.*.*` refers to specific releases.
- additionally (usage is not recommended), we release images
  for each branch.

### Security note

CrateDB versions > 4.6 is affected by [log4 security issue](https://www.lunasec.io/docs/blog/log4j-zero-day/).
We recommend to update your deployments to CrateDB 4.6.5.
For CrateDB versions >= 3.2.0 it is possible to [mitigate](https://www.lunasec.io/docs/blog/log4j-zero-day-mitigation-guide/#option-2-enable-formatmsgnolookups)
the issue setting  `-Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true` via `CRATE_JAVA_OPTS`
or by setting the environment variable `LOG4J_FORMAT_MSG_NO_LOOKUPS=true`.
