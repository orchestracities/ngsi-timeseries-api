QuantumLeap is the first implementation of [an API](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/smartsdk/ngsi-tsdb)
that supports the storage of [FIWARE NGSIv2](https://fiware.github.io/specifications/ngsiv2/stable/)
data into a [time series database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_series_database).
It currently also experimentally supports the injection of
[NGSI-LD](https://www.etsi.org/deliver/etsi_gs/CIM/001_099/009/01.01.01_60/gs_CIM009v010101p.pdf) in 
a backward compatible way with NGSI-v2 API. I.e. you can retrieve NGSI-LD stored data via NGSI v2
API and retrieve data will be describe following NGSI v2 format.

QuantumLeap is not a [real time](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Real-time_computing)
API, its purpose is to process notifications received from the Context Broker
and to create temporal records for them. In general, the whole FIWARE stack,
being based on a micro-service architecture, cannot be regarded as real time
in case you have requirements on guaranteed delivery in a given amount of time.

However, even though hard real time may not be FIWARE's forte, in our experience
a properly tuned FIWARE stack can perform extremely well and
handle very demanding IoT workloads without a glitch - you just need to
configure your infrastructure to handle that :)

## Install

Refer to the [Installation Guide](https://quantumleap.readthedocs.io/en/latest/admin/).

QuantumLeap supports both Crate DB and Timescale as time-series DB
backends but please bear in mind that at the moment we only support
the following versions:

* Crate backend: Crate DB version `3.3.*` (will be deprecated from QL `0.9` version) and `4.*`
* Timescale backend: Postgres version `10.*` or `11.*` +
  Timescale extension `1.3.*` + Postgis extension `2.5.*`.
  
PR #373 introduced basic support for NGSI-LD. In short this means that using
the current endpoint you are able to store NGSI-LD payloads with few caveats (see #398)
